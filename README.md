# Password-Generator

I had no idea what I was doing the entire time. I googled everything, because I completely forgot how to do any of this. My script.js is really messy, because prompts don't really have a way to force them to take numbers well. I could not figure out how to make parseInt work. It broke my code a million times, and so I had to accept defeat. 

The success was that it works, however, my prompts can be bypassed fairly easily. 

The difficulties I had were with everything. I did not find a single thing in this exercise to be logical or understandable. Why did we do this with prompts, when the entire world has tutorials on doing it within forms in html? I learned more about forms doing this than I did about prompts.
